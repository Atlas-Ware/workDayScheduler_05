# Albistu Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to 
save events for each hour of the work day (9a-5p).

## Deployed Project
https://atlas-ware.github.io/workDayScheduler_05/

## Usage

WHEN I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
<br>
WHEN I scroll down I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours (9a-5p)
<br>
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded 
to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green).
<br>
WHEN I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event & click the save button for that timeblock.
